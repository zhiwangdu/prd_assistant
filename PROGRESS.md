# Development Progress

Last updated: 2026-06-22

Historical main-branch progress was archived to
`docs/archive/PROGRESS-history-main-2026-06-22.md`.

## Current Branch

- Branch: `rewrite/local-toolhub-rust`
- Base: `origin/main`
- Product direction: Local Tool/MCP Workbench
- Runtime target: Rust single binary + WebUI static files + local tools dir + local data dir

## 2026-06-22 Documentation Pivot

- Reframed LogAgent from a Claude Code-backed analysis workbench into a local tools and MCP workbench.
- Updated root README/SPEC and AGENTS instructions to make Tools, MCP, artifacts, Metadata, Fetch, Executors and local deployment the primary product surface.
- Rewrote Server docs to guide slimming the existing Rust server instead of restoring the old V1 analysis architecture.
- Rewrote WebUI docs to make Tools/Runs/Metadata/Fetch/Executors/MCP/Settings the target navigation.
- Rewrote deploy and testing docs around single-machine Rust runtime and deterministic tool/MCP testing.
- Rewrote all owned `docs/modules/*` README/SPEC files so Analysis Agent, LLM Gateway and Agent Backends are optional automation/client integration rather than core runtime dependencies.
- Updated Chrome Extension and Native Agent docs as optional file import bridges.

## Next Steps

- Implement WebUI navigation pivot to Tools-first.
- Split or hide Agent/Analyze-only UI paths behind optional workflow mode.
- Consolidate HTTP APIs around tools, runs, artifacts, metadata, fetch, executors, MCP and settings.
- Keep old session/task analysis code only as a migration source until replaced.
- Add a local-toolhub config example and deployment smoke.

## Verification

- `git diff --check`
- stale wording scan over owned docs; remaining hits are explicit non-goal,
  optional automation or migration-source wording
- `cd webui && npm run lint`
- `cd webui && npm run typecheck`
- `cd webui && npm run build`
- docs-only status review
